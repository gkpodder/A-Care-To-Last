                <p>Started by 3 students, “A Care to Last” is a student-led organization based in White Oaks Secondary School and in collaboration with Jake’s House charity in Toronto, ON. We aim to create a more accepting and mindful society by raising awareness and providing monetary support for children and teens who have autism. White Oaks is home to a renowned Community Pathways Program, that provides incredible support to children with learning disabilities. We saw what our school is doing to make a difference, and decided to extend its reach further into our community.</p>

                    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
                    <p>We want everyone to go beyond just helping and respect people with autism for who they are. Our first priority is to help clear the existing stigma in our community and for everyone to see the autism community as individuals who should be given the same respect as any other.</p>

                    <h2>Awareness</h2>
                    <p>There is a huge lack of public knowledge on the subject of autism. Autism isn’t just a brain disorder or a product of bad parenting like some may think. That is why our second goal is to educate our community on these misconceptions and to spread awareness about real problems.</p>

                    <h2>Action</h2>
                    <p>“Action speaks louder than words” is how the saying goes and that is why we as an organization are holding fundraisers, educating others and participating in events to help the autism community. We want not just us but the whole community to take part in helping each other grow.</p>

                        <p>Meeting with Jake’s House to discuss collaborations on future events and projects.

                        <p>We hosted a school-wide samosa and merchandise sale. The event was a huge success and allowed us to share valuable information about the autism community with students and faculty. As a result, we were able to have productive discussions and raised over $200 which was donated to Jake’s House to go towards their legends mentoring program.</p>

                        <h2>January 2020</h2>
                        <p>“A Care To Last” participated in Jake’s House monthly Minecraft workshop. This event helps children learn block coding through Minecraft which helps build a good base for kids to develop their own interests. There was great reception to the event from the kids and parents. It’s amazing to see what a child’s imagination can do given the tools.</p>

                        <p>We are planning on having a volunteer fair to raise more help for Jake’s House. Currently, we have been in talks with Sheridan College to set up a booth once the pandemic subsides. Our hope with this event is to at least garner more attention about autism within the community and cultivate volunteer initiatives. </p>
